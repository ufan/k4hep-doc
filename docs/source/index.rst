Welcome to k4megat dive-series documentation!
===================================

The **Dive-series** aims to provide k4megat developers a deep insight into the building
blocks of `k4megat` software, i.e.:
- `DD4hep <https://dd4hep.web.cern.ch/dd4hep/>`
- `EDM4hep <https://edm4hep.web.cern.ch/>`
- `Gaudi <https://gaudi-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`

They are based on my learning notes, and no guarantee that they are correct (since they are based
on my personal knowlegebase).
But, I think they are still valuable to give you a quick overview.
The official documentation and some published paper and talk should still be a developer's main reference
sources.
And the original source code is the final auditor.

.. note::

   Some links may be invalid since they point to a local filesystem path in my personal computer.
   This is due to the fact the documents are exported from my org-mode notes.
   Clean-up is definely needed in the future.
